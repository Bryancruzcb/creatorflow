# Motion copy-detection test set

The safety net for every motion-engine change (handoff Phase 0). `npm test` runs
`copyDetection.test.ts`, which grades the engine over ~213 labeled cases and prints a
recall / false-positive scorecard. Per-case flag outcomes are pinned in
`scorecard.baseline.json` — an engine change that moves any case across the flag
threshold fails CI until the baseline is regenerated on purpose:

    UPDATE_MOTION_BASELINE=1 npm test    # then commit the diff and report before/after

    # PowerShell:  $env:UPDATE_MOTION_BASELINE = '1'; npm test; Remove-Item Env:UPDATE_MOTION_BASELINE

## Labels

- **Positives** (should match): programmatic derivations of each clip — `reupload`
  (identical), `retime-fast`/`retime-slow` (uniform speed change), `hold` (inserted
  pause), `rescale` (positions ×1.25), `relocate` (root offset), `mirror` (left/right
  joint swap + reflected curves).
- **Negatives** (should NOT match): distinct clips on the same rig. `family` = same
  gait family (Walking↔Running, Walk↔Run) — different works; flagging them is a false
  accusation. Never cross-rig: different skeletons share no joints, so those pairs
  prove nothing.
- **Variant** (reported, ungraded): Walking↔WalkJump — WalkJump is built from Walking,
  so neither label is honest.

## Honesty caveats

- Mirrored fixtures swap left/right joints and reflect curves across the YZ plane.
  That is a faithful mirror only insofar as the rigs are left/right symmetric (both
  are, near enough). At baseline the engine already flags 10/17 mirrored fixtures
  (58.8%): every hit is on the robot rig's symmetric holds and gross-motion clips
  (Dance, Death, Idle, Jump, No, Sitting, Standing, Walking, WalkJump, Yes), while it
  misses all 3 fox rig mirrors (Run, Survey, Walk) and 4 more robot clips (Punch,
  Running, ThumbsUp, Wave). Dedicated mirror canonicalization — to close that gap on
  purpose rather than by accident — is still Phase 3's job.
- A scorecard number is a measurement, not a verdict. Precision (not flagging the
  innocent) outranks recall — a change that raises recall by raising the family/unrelated
  false-positive rate is a regression.

## Regenerating fixtures

    npm run fixtures:motion   # re-extracts from public/assets/*.glb via three's GLTFLoader

Fixtures are committed; regenerate only when the GLBs or three's loader change, and
expect the baseline to need a rerun afterwards.
